# TheAlmightySorlo

This is a platformer game in Java starring a wizard, Sorlo, that has to save the princess. The problem is that in order to pluck up the courage to do so, he needs to drink wine, thus make it harder to pass all the levels. The game has 2 levels implemented so far, where the wizard has to fight the ghosts of the castle by choosing the right color of the ghost, this being a challenge as he is drunk and the colors are moving before him. He also has to climb ladders, ropes and to beware of lasers which might kill him. In order to open the door to the next level he also needs to collect all the keys and barrels of wine (the keys for the door and the wine for courage as he can't open the door without it).
The game also can let you choose which song you want as soundtrack during your play(e.g. pirates of the caribbean) and when it is reopened it will open with the level you were before closing tha game.
